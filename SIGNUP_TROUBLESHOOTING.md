## ✅ Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Enable Firestore Database

**This is the most likely cause!**

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **syncup-social-app-2025**
3. Click **Firestore Database** in left sidebar
4. If you see "Create database" → **Click it!**
5. Choose **"Start in production mode"**
6. Select location (e.g., us-central)
7. Click **"Enable"**
8. Wait 1-2 minutes for database to initialize

### Solution 2: Set Firestore Security Rules

After enabling Firestore:

1. Click **"Rules"** tab in Firestore
2. Replace with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **"Publish"**

### Solution 3: Clean and Rebuild

```powershell
# Stop the app first (Ctrl+C in terminal)

# Clean
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Rebuild and run
flutter run
```

### Solution 4: Check Console Errors

When you click "Sign Up", look for errors like:

**Error 1: "Permission denied"**
```
Solution: Set Firestore rules (see Solution 2)
```

**Error 2: "Cloud Firestore is not available"**
```
Solution: Enable Firestore (see Solution 1)
```

**Error 3: "Username is already taken"**
```
Solution: Try a different username
```

**Error 4: Network error**
```
Solution: Check internet connection
```
