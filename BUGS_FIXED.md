# üêõ Bugs Fixed - October 20, 2025

## Critical Fixes ‚úÖ

### 1. **Unused Variable in Theme** - `lib/core/theme.dart`
**Issue:** Variable `darkScheme` was declared but never used in `buildAppTheme()`.
**Fix:** Removed unused variable declaration from light theme function.
**Impact:** Eliminates compile warning, improves code clarity.

---

### 2. **Hardcoded Test Credentials Removed** - `lib/features/auth/sign_in_page.dart`
**Issue:** Test credentials (email='1', password='1') hardcoded in production code.
**Fix:** Removed hardcoded bypass logic.
**Impact:** Improved security, all users now go through proper Firebase authentication.

---

### 3. **Release Build Signing Configuration** - `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
**Issue:** Release builds used debug signing keys, preventing Play Store deployment.
**Fix:** 
- Added proper signing config with key.properties support
- Created `key.properties.example` template
- Automatically falls back to debug keys in development
**Impact:** App can now be properly signed for production release.
**Note:** Create `android/app/key.properties` with your signing credentials before production build.

## High Priority Fixes ‚úÖ

### 4. **Memory Leak - Timer Not Disposed** - `lib/features/chat/individual_chat_page.dart`
**Issue:** `_recordingTimer` was created but never canceled in dispose().
**Fix:** 
- Added `Timer?` declaration
- Added `_recordingTimer?.cancel()` in dispose()
- Added proper timer initialization in recording logic
- Added `dart:async` import
**Impact:** Prevents memory leaks and potential app crashes.

---

### 5. **Missing Mounted Checks** - `lib/features/chat/individual_chat_page.dart`
**Issue:** `setState()` called without checking if widget is mounted.
**Fix:** Added `if (!mounted) return;` checks before all `setState()` calls.
**Impact:** Prevents crashes when widget is disposed during async operations.

---

## Medium Priority Fixes ‚úÖ

### 6. **Image Error Widget Layout** - `lib/features/home/widgets/post_card.dart`
**Issue:** Error placeholder had height but no width specified.
**Fix:** Added `width: double.infinity` to error container.
**Impact:** Consistent layout when images fail to load.

---

### 7. **Camera Lifecycle Management** - `lib/features/reels/create_reel_modern.dart`
**Issue:** Camera controller disposed without updating state, causing null reference errors.
**Fix:** Added state update after camera disposal in `didChangeAppLifecycleState`.
```dart
if (mounted) {
  setState(() {
    _cameraController = null;
    _isCameraReady = false;
  });
}
```
**Impact:** Prevents null pointer exceptions when app is paused/resumed.

## Remaining TODOs (Not Bugs, Feature Placeholders)

These are intentional placeholders for future development:

1. **Reels Comment Submission** - `lib/features/reels/reels_page_new.dart:852`
   - Currently shows "coming soon" - needs backend integration
   
2. **Post Upload to Server** - `lib/features/add/create_post_page.dart:108, 235`
   - Needs Firebase Storage/Firestore integration
   
3. **Profile Navigation** - `lib/features/profile/pages/widgets/post_header.dart:50`
   - Needs user profile routing implementation

## Testing Checklist ‚úÖ

- [x] Theme compiles without warnings
- [x] Authentication works without test credentials
- [x] Chat page doesn't leak memory
- [x] Camera lifecycle handled properly
- [x] Post cards display properly with error handling
- [x] No setState after dispose errors
- [x] Release build signing configuration ready

---

## Performance Improvements

- Removed unused variables
- Added proper disposal patterns
- Improved async operation safety
- Better state management

---

## Security Improvements

- Removed hardcoded credentials
- Added proper release signing configuration
- Separated signing keys from source code

---

## Notes for Production

1. **Before Production Release:**
   - Create `android/app/key.properties` with your keystore credentials
   - Generate a release keystore if you don't have one
   - Test release build: `flutter build apk --release`
   - Update Application ID if needed in `build.gradle.kts`

2. **Keystore Generation (if needed):**
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/sync_up-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias sync_up
   ```

3. **Example key.properties:**
   ```
   storePassword=your_store_password
   keyPassword=your_key_password
   keyAlias=sync_up
   storeFile=/path/to/sync_up-release-key.jks
   ```
