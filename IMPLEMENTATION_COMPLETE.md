## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the new card layout"

- ✅ Not tapping a REEL (reels page stays full-screen)
- ✅ Card layout is for posts only

### "I don't see floating hearts in reels"
- ✅ Make sure you DOUBLE-TAP (not single tap like button)
- ✅ Hearts are small and fade quickly (look for upward motion)
- ✅ Try double-tapping multiple times to see more hearts

### "Floating hearts aren't showing"
- ✅ Double-tap the IMAGE area (not buttons)
- ✅ Make sure post/reel is actually being liked
- ✅ Hearts spawn from bottom and drift upward (subtle)

- Reels feel like reels  
- Clear mental model for users

### Why Floating Hearts?

**Adds Delight:**
- Visual feedback beyond static icon
- Creates sense of celebration
- Makes interactions feel rewarding
- Industry standard (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)

**Result:**
- More engaging experience
- Premium feel
- Users enjoy interacting more
