# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: OAuth Migration Instructions

## Current Status

Your app currently uses **Firebase OAuth** for Google, Apple, and Microsoft sign-in.

To fully migrate to **Supabase OAuth**, you have TWO options:

---

## Option 1: Disable OAuth Temporarily (RECOMMENDED FOR NOW)

Since setting up OAuth requires external credentials (Google Cloud, Apple Developer, Azure), I recommend:

### Steps:
1. **Comment out or hide OAuth buttons** in the sign-in page
2. **Use only Email/Password authentication** for now
3. **Set up OAuth providers later** when you're ready

### Quick Fix:
In `lib/features/auth/sign_in_page.dart`, find the OAuth buttons and comment them out or set:
```dart
// Temporarily disable OAuth
bool _showOAuthButtons = false;
```

## Option 2: Complete OAuth Migration (REQUIRES SETUP)

### Required Steps:

#### 1. **Google OAuth**
- Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
- Get Client ID and Client Secret
- Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google
- See detailed steps in `SUPABASE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`

#### 2. **Apple OAuth** (iOS only)
- Requires Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
- Create Services ID, Key ID, and Private Key
- Configure in Supabase
- See detailed steps in `SUPABASE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`

#### 3. **Microsoft OAuth**
- Create app in Azure Portal
- Get Client ID and Secret
- Configure in Supabase
- See detailed steps in `SUPABASE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`

#### 4. **Update Code**
- Replace Firebase OAuth calls with Supabase OAuth
- Update deep linking configuration
- Test each provider

## My Recommendation

**For now:**
1. ✅ **Email/Password auth is working** with both Firebase and Supabase
2. ✅ **User data is being saved to both databases**
3. ✅ **Profile photos upload to Supabase**
4. ⏳ **OAuth can wait** until you're ready to set up the external providers

**When you're ready for OAuth:**
1. Follow `SUPABASE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` step by step
2. I can help update the code once you have the credentials

## What's Working Now

✅ Email/Password sign-up → Saves to both Firebase Auth + Supabase
✅ Email/Password sign-in → Checks both databases
✅ Profile photo upload → Saves to Supabase Storage + both databases
✅ Profile data → Syncs between Firebase and Supabase
✅ User validation → Shows message if user tries to sign in without signing up

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app now** - Email/Password auth should work perfectly
2. **Decide if you need OAuth** - Many apps don't use it
3. **If you want OAuth** - Set up one provider at a time (start with Google, it's easiest)
4. **Let me know** when you're ready and I'll help update the OAuth code
