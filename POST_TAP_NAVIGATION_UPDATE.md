# Post Tap Navigation Update

## Overview
Implemented tap-to-open functionality for posts in both the Home Page and Profile Page, allowing users to view posts in the premium full-screen Post Viewer with all interactions.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Home Page Posts** (`lib/features/home/widgets/post_card.dart`)
- ✅ Added imports for profile PostModel and PostViewerPage
- ✅ Created `_openPostViewer()` method that:
  - Converts home `Post` model to profile `PostModel`
  - Navigates to full-screen `PostViewerPage`
  - Passes current post data (likes, comments, shares)
- ✅ Wrapped post image in `GestureDetector` with `onTap` handler

**User Experience:**
- Tap on any post image in the home feed
- Opens in full-screen viewer with:
  - Vertical swipe navigation
  - Double-tap to like
  - All interaction buttons (like, comment, share, save)
  - Floating reactions
  - Premium animations

### 2. **Profile Page Posts** (`lib/features/profile/profile_page.dart`)
- ✅ Added imports for PostModel and PostViewerPage
- ✅ Created `_openPostViewer()` method that:
  - Converts all grid images to `PostModel` list
  - Opens viewer at tapped post index
  - Enables vertical navigation through all posts
- ✅ Wrapped grid items in `GestureDetector` with `onTap` handler

**User Experience:**
- Tap on any post in the 2-column grid
- Opens in full-screen viewer starting at selected post
- Swipe up/down to navigate through all profile posts
- All premium interactions available

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Conversion (Home Post → Profile PostModel)
```dart
// Home Post model has: imageUrl, userName, likes, comments, shares
// Profile PostModel requires: mediaUrls, username, timestamp, etc.

final profilePost = profile_post.PostModel(
  id: timestamp,
  type: PostType.image,
  mediaUrls: [imageUrl],
  thumbnailUrl: imageUrl,
  username: userName,
  userAvatar: userAvatarUrl,
  timestamp: DateTime.now(),
  likes: parsedLikes,
  comments: parsedComments,
  shares: parsedShares,
  views: estimate,
);
```

### Navigation
```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PostViewerPage(
      initialPost: post,
      allPosts: [post], // or full list for profile
    ),
  ),
);
```
