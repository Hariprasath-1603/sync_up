# Comments and Camera Improvements - Update Summary

## Overview
This update addresses three key improvements requested by the user:
1. Camera scaling in create reel page (to match Instagram/Facebook style)
2. Reply functionality in reel page comments
3. Reply functionality in home page post comments

## Changes Made

### 1. Create Reel Camera Scaling Fix ✅
**File:** `lib/features/reels/create_reel_modern.dart`

**Problem:** Camera output was appearing narrow/cropped instead of filling the screen properly like Instagram and Facebook.

**Solution:** Applied the same Transform.scale logic used in `go_live_page.dart` to scale the camera preview to fill the screen while maintaining aspect ratio:

```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (context, constraints) {
    final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
    final deviceRatio = size.width / size.height;
    final cameraRatio = controller.value.aspectRatio;

    double scale;
    if (cameraRatio > deviceRatio) {
      // Camera is wider, scale based on height
      scale = 1 / cameraRatio / deviceRatio;
    } else {
      // Camera is taller, scale based on width
      scale = 1.0;
    }

    return Transform.scale(
      scale: scale,
      child: Center(child: CameraPreview(controller)),
    );
  },
)
```

**Result:** Camera preview now properly fills the screen with correct aspect ratio, matching the behavior of Instagram/Facebook reel cameras.
