# ✅ FIXES APPLIED - Login & Session Persistence

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ User Not Staying Logged In After Closing App
**Problem**: After successful signup/login and closing the app, users were asked to login again.

**Root Cause**: App wasn't checking Supabase session on startup, only checking `PreferencesService`.

**Fix Applied**:

#### File: `lib/core/app_router.dart`
- ✅ Added Supabase session check as primary method
- ✅ Added `PreferencesService` check as backup
- ✅ Added debug logging to track user state

**Before**:
```dart
String _getInitialLocation() {
  if (PreferencesService.isLoggedIn()) {
    return '/home';
  }
  // ...
}
```

**After**:
```dart
String _getInitialLocation() {
  // Check Supabase session FIRST (most reliable)
  final session = Supabase.instance.client.auth.currentSession;
  if (session != null && session.user != null) {
    print('✅ User session found: ${session.user.email}');
    return '/home';
  }
  
  // Backup check via preferences
  if (PreferencesService.isLoggedIn()) {
    print('✅ User logged in via preferences');
    return '/home';
  }
  // ...
}
```

#### File: `lib/features/auth/otp_verification_page.dart`
- ✅ Added session saving after successful signup
- ✅ Imported `PreferencesService`
- ✅ Added debug logging

**Added code**:
```dart
// Save user session to preferences (for persistent login)
await PreferencesService.saveUserSession(
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email ?? widget.email,
  name: completeUserData['display_name'] as String?,
);

print('✅ User session saved - user will stay logged in');
```

### 2. ❌ Login Shows Generic Error for Wrong Credentials
**Problem**: When entering correct email/username but wrong password (or vice versa), app showed "check your mail or username and pw" but wasn't specific about what was wrong.

**Root Cause**: Error handling wasn't catching all Supabase Auth error variations.

**Fix Applied**:

#### File: `lib/features/auth/sign_in_page.dart`
- ✅ Added better error message parsing
- ✅ Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Improved error specificity

**Changes**:

1. **Added debug logging**:
```dart
// Before sign in
print('🔐 Attempting sign in with email: $email');

// After sign in
print('✅ Sign in successful! User: ${authResponse.user?.email}');
print('👤 User profile found: ${supabaseUser != null}');

// On error
print('❌ Auth error: ${e.message}');
print('❌ Status code: ${e.statusCode}');
```

2. **Improved error messages**:
```dart
// More specific error handling
if (e.message.toLowerCase().contains('invalid') ||
    e.message.toLowerCase().contains('credentials') ||
    e.statusCode == '400') {
  errorMessage = 'Incorrect email/username or password. Please check and try again.';
} else if (e.message.toLowerCase().contains('email not confirmed')) {
  errorMessage = 'Please verify your email before signing in. Check your inbox for verification code.';
} else if (e.message.toLowerCase().contains('too many requests')) {
  errorMessage = 'Too many attempts. Please try again in a few minutes.';
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Session Persistence Flow:

1. **Sign Up**:
   - User signs up with email and phone
   - Verifies email OTP ✅
   - Verifies phone OTP ✅
   - Clicks "Complete Signup"
   - ✅ **Session saved to SharedPreferences**
   - ✅ **Supabase session automatically persists**
   - Navigate to home page

2. **Close & Reopen App**:
   - App checks Supabase session first ✅
   - If session exists → Go to `/home` ✅
   - If no session, check preferences ✅
   - If logged in → Go to `/home` ✅
   - Otherwise → Go to `/signin`

3. **Sign In**:
   - User enters email/username and password
   - ✅ **Session saved to SharedPreferences**
   - ✅ **Supabase session automatically persists**
   - Navigate to home page

4. **Next App Launch**:
   - ✅ User goes directly to home page
   - ✅ No need to login again!

### Login Error Messages:

| Error Scenario | Old Message | New Message |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong password | "Sign-in failed" | "Incorrect email/username or password" |
| Username not found | "Username not found" | "Username not found. Please check and try again." |
| Email not verified | Generic error | "Please verify your email before signing in" |
| Too many attempts | Generic error | "Too many attempts. Please try again in a few minutes" |
| Network error | Generic error | "Network error. Please check your connection" |

## 🧪 Test The Changes

### Test 1: Session Persistence

1. **Sign up new user**:
   ```
   - Fill signup form
   - Verify email OTP
   - Verify phone OTP
   - Complete signup
   - ✅ Navigates to home page
   ```

2. **Close the app completely**

3. **Reopen the app**:
   ```
   ✅ Should go directly to home page
   ❌ Should NOT show onboarding or signin
   ```

4. **Check debug logs**:
   ```
   Look for: "✅ User session found: [email]"
   ```

---

### Test 2: Login with Email

1. **Go to Sign In page**

2. **Enter credentials**:
   ```
   Email: test@example.com
   Password: correct_password
   ```

3. **Click Sign In**:
   ```
   ✅ Should log in successfully
   ✅ Navigate to home page
   ```

4. **Close and reopen**:
   ```
   ✅ Should stay logged in
   ```

---

### Test 3: Login with Username

2. **Enter credentials**:
   ```
   Username: testuser
   Password: correct_password
   ```

3. **Click Sign In**:
   ```
   🔍 App looks up email from username
   ✅ Should log in successfully

   Password: wrong_password
   ```

2. **Expected result**:
   ```
   ❌ Error: "Incorrect email/username or password. Please check and try again."
   📊 Debug log: "❌ Auth error: Invalid login credentials"

   ```
   Username: nonexistent
   Password: any_password
   ```

4. **Expected result**:
   ```
   ❌ Error: "Username not found. Please check and try again."
   📊 Debug log will show username lookup failed
   ```

## 📊 Debug Logs to Look For

### Successful Login:
```
🔐 Attempting sign in with email: test@example.com
✅ Sign in successful! User: test@example.com
👤 User profile found: true
✅ User session saved - user will stay logged in
