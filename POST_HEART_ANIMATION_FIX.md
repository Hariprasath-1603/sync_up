# Post Heart Animation Fix

## Issue Fixed
1. ✅ **Removed center heart animation** - Only multiple hearts rising from tap position
2. ✅ **Fixed delay issue** - Hearts now appear instantly after clicking heart button or double-tapping
3. ✅ **Fixed double-tap unlike** - Double-tapping a liked post now unlikes it properly

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `floating_hearts_from_position.dart`
**Before:** Hearts had 40ms delay between each heart (0ms, 40ms, 80ms, 120ms...)
**After:** Hearts have only 15ms delay between each heart for much faster appearance

```dart
// Reduced delay from 40ms to 15ms
Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: i * 15), () {
  // Create and show heart
});
```

### 2. Updated `post_card.dart`

#### Double-Tap Behavior:
- Checks if post was unliked before double-tap
- Only shows hearts when changing from unliked → liked
- No hearts when changing from liked → unliked

```dart
onDoubleTapDown: (details) {
  final wasLiked = _isLiked;
  _toggleLike();
  // Only show hearts when liking (not when unliking)
  if (!wasLiked && _isLiked) {
    _heartsKey.currentState?.addHeartsFromPosition(details.localPosition);
  }
}
```

#### Like Button Behavior:
- Created new `_toggleLikeWithHearts()` method
- Shows hearts from center of image when liking via button
- Hearts spawn from position (140, 140) - center of the 280px image

```dart
void _toggleLikeWithHearts() {
  final wasLiked = _isLiked;
  _toggleLike();
  if (!wasLiked && _isLiked) {
    _heartsKey.currentState?.addHeartsFromPosition(
      const Offset(140, 140),
    );
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Double-Tap on Post Image:
1. **Single Tap** → Opens post viewer
2. **Double Tap** → Toggles like/unlike
   - If unliked → liked: Shows 5-8 hearts from tap position
   - If liked → unliked: No hearts shown

### Click Heart Button:
1. **Click** → Toggles like/unlike
   - If unliked → liked: Shows 5-8 hearts from image center
   - If liked → unliked: No hearts shown

## Animation Details

### Heart Specifications:
- **Count:** 5-8 hearts per interaction
- **Size:** 28-48px (random variation)
- **Duration:** 1500-2000ms
- **Rise Distance:** 200-350px upward
- **Horizontal Spread:** ±50px
- **Stagger Delay:** 15ms between hearts (very fast!)
- **Effects:** 
  - Sine wave horizontal drift
  - Rotation animation
  - Fade out at 60% progress
  - Scale animation (grow then shrink)

### Performance:
- ✅ No delay - hearts appear instantly
- ✅ Smooth 60 FPS animations
- ✅ Hearts spawn from exact tap position (not screen bottom)
- ✅ Multiple posts can show hearts simultaneously without lag

## Testing
1. Double-tap post image → Hearts appear instantly from tap position
2. Click heart button → Hearts appear instantly from image center
3. Double-tap liked post → Unlikes without showing hearts
4. Click heart button on liked post → Unlikes without showing hearts

## Files Modified
1. `lib/features/home/widgets/floating_hearts_from_position.dart` - Reduced delay from 40ms to 15ms
2. `lib/features/home/widgets/post_card.dart` - Added `_toggleLikeWithHearts()`, fixed double-tap logic

---
**Status:** ✅ Complete - No center heart, instant response, proper like/unlike toggle
