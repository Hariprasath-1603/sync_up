## ⚙️ How to Customize

### Change Exit Timeout (Default: 2 seconds)
```dart
// In lib/core/utils/back_button_handler.dart
// Line 9
static const Duration _exitTimeGap = Duration(seconds: 2);

// Change to 3 seconds:
static const Duration _exitTimeGap = Duration(seconds: 3);
```

### Add/Remove Main Screens
```dart
// In lib/core/utils/back_button_handler.dart
// Line 12-17
static const List<String> _mainScreens = [
  '/home',
  '/search',
  '/reels',
  '/profile',
  '/messages', // Add your screen
];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Back button does nothing
**Fix:** Make sure you ran `flutter run` after the changes

### Issue: App exits immediately (no double-tap)
**Fix:** Check that your routes match exactly:
```dart
// They should be:
'/home' not 'home'
'/search' not '/search/'
```

### Issue: Snackbar not showing
**Fix:** This is normal on first run, try pressing back again
