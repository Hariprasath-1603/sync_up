# Stories Archive Update - Calendar Filter Implementation

## Overview
Updated the stories archive page to show ALL individual archived stories with calendar-based filtering instead of grouped memories/categories.

## Major Changes

### 1. ✅ Calendar Filter System
**Previous**: Day-based filters (All, Today, 7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days)
**Now**: Calendar-based filtering with two options:
- **Single Date Picker**: Select a specific date to view stories from that day
- **Date Range Picker**: Select a date range to view stories within that period
- **Clear Filter**: Remove active filter to show all stories

### 2. ✅ Individual Story Display
**Previous**: Stories grouped by category (Travel, Food, Friends, Hangout)
**Now**: All individual stories displayed chronologically with:
- Date-based grouping (Today, Yesterday, Day names, or full dates)
- 3-column grid layout per date section
- Each story shown as individual card
- Story details: mood emoji, time ago, clip count

### 3. ✅ Enhanced UI Features
- **Calendar Icon** in app bar (highlights when filter is active)
- **Filter Info Banner** showing active date/range filter
- **Date Section Headers** with story count for each date
- **Story Cards** with:
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Mood emoji display
  - Time ago indicator
  - Clip count badge
  - Tap to open story viewer

---

## Implementation Details

### Calendar Filter Modal
```dart
showModalBottomSheet with:
- "Select Single Date" button → Opens DatePicker
- "Select Date Range" button → Opens DateRangePicker  
- "Clear Filter" button → Removes active filter
- Theme-aware styling with kPrimary
```

### Filtering Logic
```dart
_selectedDate → Filter by specific day
_selectedDateRange → Filter by date range
_getFilteredStories() → Returns filtered list
_getStoriesGroupedByDate() → Groups by date keys
```

### Date Grouping
- **Today**: Stories from current day
- **Yesterday**: Stories from previous day
- **Day Names**: Stories within last 7 days (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- **Full Dates**: Older stories (15/10/2025 format)

### Story Card Information
- **Background**: Gradient with kPrimary colors
- **Mood**: Emoji/text at bottom left
- **Time**: Relative time (5h ago, 2d ago)
- **Badge**: Number of clips in top right
- **Action**: Tap to open in story viewer
